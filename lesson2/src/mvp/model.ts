// Welcome to the model!
// In this file, we are supposed to connect to a database and perform CRUD operation on data there.
// However, since it is too complicated right now.
// We are just going to create a class that represent the data and another that represents the database instead.

// First, please create Account class.
// This class should have a constructor and property 'name' 'password' and 'amount'

// Next, please create Database class.
// This class should have static property 'accounts'
// In addition, it also should have static functions 'create' and 'update'
// 'create' should receive 'name' 'password' and 'amount' as an input and create a new Account instance into the 'accounts' array.
// 'update' should receive 'name' and 'amount' as an input and modify the Account instance in the 'accounts' array.
