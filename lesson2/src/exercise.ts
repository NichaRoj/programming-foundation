/**
 * Exercise!
 *
 * Let's try creating some interfaces and classes!
 * Imagine you are the owner of a pizzaria. You would need to create pizzas!
 * First, create a template for pizzas on the menu. Each pizza should have a name and a list (or array) of toppings!
 *
 * Then, because we are in the future, we can just create a pizza maker!
 * Try creating a class of PizzaMaker which has a list of pizzas on the menu (which we will call menu for short),
 * and a function to create a pizza! This `create` function should have a name as an input
 * and return an object with the name and its toppings as an output.
